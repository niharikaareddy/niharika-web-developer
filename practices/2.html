ISRO    
</h1>
<p class="odd">Indian Space Research Organisation is India's national space agency.
     It serves as the principal research and development arm of the 
     Department of Space (DoS), overseen by the Prime Minister
     of India, with the Chairman of ISRO also serving as the chief executive of the DoS. It is primarily responsible for space-based operations, space exploration,
     international space cooperation and the development of related technologies.[3] The agency maintains a constellation of imaging, communication and remote sensing satellites.
    It operates the GAGAN and IRNSS satellite navigation systems. It has sent three missions to the Moon and one mission to Mars.</p1>
<p class="even">Formerly known as the Indian National Committee for Space Research 
    (INCOSPAR), it was set up in 1962 by 
    then-Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru on t
    he recommendation of scientist Vikram Sarabhai.
     It was renamed as ISRO in 1969 and was 
     subsumed into the Department of Atomic Energy 
     (DAE).[4] The establishment of ISRO institutionalised space research activities in India.[5][6] In 1972, 
     the Government set up a Space Commission and the DoS, bringing ISRO under its purview. It has since then been managed by the DoS, which also governs various other 
     institutions in the domain of astronomy and space technology.[7]</p1>
